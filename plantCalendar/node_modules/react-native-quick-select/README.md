The snippet below shows how the component can be used


```javascript
// import component
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import MultiSelect from 'react-native-multiple-select';
 
let 

class MultiSelectExample extends Component {

  this.state = {
    selectedItems = [];
  };

  this.items = [{
    id: '92iijs7yta',
    name: 'Ondo',
  }, {
    id: 'a0s0a8ssbsd',
    name: 'Ogun',
  }, {
    id: '16hbajsabsd',
    name: 'Calabar',
  }, {
    id: 'nahs75a5sg',
    name: 'Lagos',
  }, {
    id: '667atsas',
    name: 'Maiduguri',
  }, {
    id: 'hsyasajs',
    name: 'Anambra',
  }, {
    id: 'djsjudksjd',
    name: 'Benue',
  }, {
    id: 'sdhyaysdj',
    name: 'Kaduna',
  }, {
    id: 'suudydjsjd',
    name: 'Abuja',
  }];

  onSelectedItemsChange = selectedItems => {
    this.setState({ selectedItems });
  };

  render() {
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <MultiSelect
        items={items}
        uniqueKey="id"
        onSelectedItemsChange={this.onSelectedItemsChange}
        selectedItems={this.state.selectedItems}
        selectText="Pick Items"
        searchInputPlaceholderText="Search Items..."
        altFontFamily="ProximaNova-Light"
        tagRemoveIconColor="#CCC"
        tagBorderColor="#CCC"
        tagTextColor="#CCC"
        selectedItemTextColor="#CCC"
        selectedItemIconColor="#CCC"
        itemTextColor="#000"
        searchInputStyle={{ color: '#CCC' }}
        submitButtonColor="#CCC"
        submitButtonText="Submit"
      />
    </View>
  }
}
    
```

The component takes 3 compulsory props - `items`, `uniqueKey` and `selectedItemsChange`. Other props are optional. The table below explains more.


## Props

| Prop        | Required   | Purpose  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| items      | Yes | (Array, control prop) List of items to display in the multi-select component. JavaScript Array of objects. Each object must contain a name and unique identifier (Check sample above) |
|selectedItems | No      | (Array, control prop) List of selected items keys . JavaScript Array of strings, that can be instantiated with the component |
| uniqueKey      | Yes      | (String) Unique identifier that is part of each item's properties. Used internally as means of identifying each item (Check sample below) |

| fontSize | No     | (Number) Font size for selected item name displayed as label for multiselect |
| fixedHeight | No     | (Boolean) Defaults to false. Specifies if select dropdown take height of content or a fixed height with a scrollBar (There is an issue with this behavior when component is nested in a ScrollView in which scroll event will only be dispatched to parent ScrollView and select component won't be scrollable). See [this issue](https://github.com/toystars/react-native-multiple-select/issues/12) for more info. |
| single | No     | (Boolean) Toggles select component between single option and multi option |
| onSelectedItemsChange | Yes      | (Function) JavaScript function passed in as an argument. The function is to be defined with an argument (selectedItems). Triggered when `Submit` button is clicked (for multi select) or item is clicked (for single select). (Check sample above) |
| selectText | No     | (String) Text displayed in main component |
| searchInputPlaceholderText | No      | (String) Placeholder text displayed in multi-select filter input |
| fontFamily | No     | (String) Custom font family to be used in component (affects all text except `searchInputPlaceholderText` described above) |
| altFontFamily | No      | (String) Font family for `searchInputPlaceholderText` |
| tagRemoveIconColor | No      | (String) Color to be used for the remove icon in selected items list |
| tagBorderColor | No      | (String) Border color for each selected item  |
| tagTextColor | No  | (String) Text color for selected items list |
| selectedItemFontFamily | No   | (String) Font family for each selected item in multi-select drop-down |

| itemFontFamily | No   | (String) Font family for each non-selected item in multi-select drop-down |
| itemTextColor | No   | (String) Text color for each non-selected item in multi-select drop-down |
| searchInputStyle | No   | (Object) Style object for multi-select input element  |
| hideSubmitButton | No | (Boolean) Defaults to false. Hide submit button from dropdown, and rather use arrow-button in search field"
| submitButtonColor | No   | (String) Background color for submit button  |
| submitButtonText | No   | (String) Text displayed on submit button  |

## Note

- When using the `single` prop, `selectedItems` should still be passed in as an array of selected items keys. Also, when an item is selected in the single mode, the selected item is returned as an array of string.

- The `items` props must be passed as an array of objects with a compulsory `name` key present in each object as the name key is used to display the items in the options component.

### Removing all selected items

To use, add ref to MultiSelect component in parent component, then call method against reference. i.e.

```javascript
<MultiSelect
  ref={c => this._multiSelect = c}
  ...
/>

clearSelectedCategories = () => {
   this._multiSelect.removeAllItems();
};
    
```
